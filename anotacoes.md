The java.util.function Package

Of course, Predicate is not the only functional interface provided with Java SE 8. A number of standard interfaces are designed as a starter set for developers.

Predicate: A property of the object passed as argument
Consumer: An action to be performed with the object passed as argument
Function: Transform a T to a U
Supplier: Provide an instance of a T (such as a factory)
UnaryOperator: A unary operator from T -> T
BinaryOperator: A binary operator from (T, T) -> T
In addition, many of these interfaces also have primitive versions. This should give you a great starting point for your lambda expressions.
